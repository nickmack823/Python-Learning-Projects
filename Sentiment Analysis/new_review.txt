My favourite movie of all time!

That’s one way I describe this film, my dad told me about this film about 8 years ago, at 11 I didn’t fully understand this film abit confusing I found I admired Will saw him as the hero. Since that day I have watched this film hundreds of times every time I watch this film I understand it more from the little details of number painted knockoffs to the brilliant language used. This film changed my life, showed me the other side to life, I realised I was much different  to will,  for one not living  in Southie , but we similarities, I saw my self in him from his fashion sense to his friends to his persona to the misunderstanding of who he is. Unfortunately I’m not a smart as will and I look up to him.

The brilliant cinematography to the writing makes this film simply outstanding to say the least. There isn’t a single thing I would change. Quite brilliant!

To who ever reads this having watched the film or yet to watch please put it on and see the beauty it portrays.

Thank you Matt and Ben
